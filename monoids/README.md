# Monoids

A monoid is a set together with an associative opeartor that combines two elements from the set, and an identity element for the operator. 

In mathematics, a monoid is a semi-group with an identity element.  A semi-group is an associative Magma.
A magma represents a set `S` with closed binary opeartions i.e. the resulting operations produce the results in the same set `S`.
